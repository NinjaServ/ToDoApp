# ToDoApp
A simple ToDo List application project for creating, reading, modifying, and deleting ToDo events.

This application uses the Prism 6 framework for providing MVVM pattern design of the code logic and UI Interface, and to provide navigation between functional views in the application. The ToDo list data is stored in a local file in JSON format; storage is in the application's directory, in a subfolder named Data.
